You can train the agents by running the script. The script will train both Q-learning and SARSA agents and save their Q-tables.
Evaluating the Agents:

After training, you can evaluate the performance of the agents using the evalQ and evalSarsa functions.
The script will load the saved Q-tables and evaluate the agents over a specified number of episodes.
Visualizing the Agents:
